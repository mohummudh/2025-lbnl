Mathematically speaking, as long as the curve obtained above is _monotonic_, one can in principle derive a calibration function, $C(x)$,\n",

For the next chapter we will assume that this calibration is perfect; the next tutorial on ensembling will allow us to get a handle on additional uncertainties that should be accounted for due to statistical sources including this model mis-specification."
