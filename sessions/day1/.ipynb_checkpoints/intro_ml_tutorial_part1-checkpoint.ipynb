    "1. ML in theory: what is ML? how does it work? etc. \n",
    "2. ML in practice: what tools are there? how do I use them? what are the tips and tricks of the trade for doing ML on HEP data sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand nothing will make much sense if we totally skip over #1. On the other, #2 is really what you're here to know. Broadly speaking this tutorial will spend a bit of time dwelling on #1, and #2 will be the focus of the afternoon tutorial, but please let us know if we move past the fundamentals too quickly!\n"

    "2. Calculation of gradients\n",
    "3. Optimization of model parameters given said gradients\n",
    "\n",

    "- PyTorch: Probably the most widely used for research today, and what we'll be using in these tutorials. Originally developed by Meta AI\n",
    "- Tensorflow: Also frequently used, but less supported than it used to be. Originally developed by Google brain\n",
    "- JAX: Broader library for more than just training deep neural networks (see differentiable programming tutorials tomorrow), but also can be used like PyTorch or Tensorflow. Under development by Google, in some sense is Tensorflow v3.\n",
    "- Scikit Learn: Broad library of machine learning models (not just neural networks!) and utility functions. Very frequently used in combination with the other frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "Others include Apache MXNet, Keras (now integrated into Tensorflow), Theano (old school), TMVA (don't use!). You might run into these if looking at older codebases, but if starting out from scratch, you're best advised to use one of the above.\n",
